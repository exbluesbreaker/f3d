# When this file is run by CMake through the find_package command
#
# The following variables will be defined:
#
#   f3d_BINDINGS_JAVA              Will be enabled if F3D was built with java bindings
#   f3d_BINDINGS_PYTHON            Will be enabled if F3D was built with python bindings
#   f3d_BUILD_APPLICATION          Will be enabled if F3D application was built
#   f3d_CONFIG_DIR                 Path to F3D configuration directory, can be absolute or relative
#   f3d_MODULE_EXR                 Will be enabled if F3D was built with OpenEXR images support
#   f3d_MODULE_RAYTRACING          Will be enabled if F3D was built with raytracing support
#   f3d_MODULE_UI                  Will be enabled if F3D was built with ImGui support
#   f3d_MODULE_WEBP                Will be enabled if F3D was built with WebP images support
#   f3d_PLUGINS_INSTALL_DIR        Path to the location to install plugins so that F3D can find them
#
# It is also possible to look for optional components.
#
# Optional components are:
#
# `application`: If found, it the following target will exist
#
#   f3d::f3d           Target that contains the F3D executable
#
# `library`: If found, it the following target will exist
#
#   f3d::libf3d        Target that contains the libf3d
#
# And the following local variable will also be defined
#
#   f3d_INCLUDE_DIR                Absolute path to the include directory of public f3d library classes
#
# `pluginsdk`: If found many plugin related cmake macros will be available as well as the following target:
#
#   f3d::vtkext
#
# And the following local variable will also be defined
#
#   f3d_INCLUDE_DIR                Absolute path to the include directory of classes needed to build a plugin
#
# Please note, if no components are set, `library` will be added by default
